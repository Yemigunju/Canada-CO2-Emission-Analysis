## üß† Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Sourced public datasets on Canada's emissions, population, and energy use.
- **Data Cleaning:** Managed missing values, normalized time series, and categorized fuel types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed emissions by year, sector, and fuel category.
- **Visualization:** Created dashboards and graphs using Python and Power BI.

**Tools Used:**  
`Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)`, `Power BI`, `Excel`

## üìä Key Insights

- **Emissions Peak:** Emissions steadily increased until around 2008, followed by a gradual decline.
- **Sectoral Contributors:** The energy sector, particularly fossil fuels, is the dominant source of emissions.
- **Fuel Efficiency:** Different fuel types (e.g., diesel, gasoline) show varying emission efficiencies.
- **Population Link:** Emission trends closely mirror Canada's population and economic growth.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Canada has made progress toward reducing emissions, particularly through policy reforms and renewable energy investments. However, significant reliance on fossil fuels persists. Data indicates that stronger measures targeting clean energy adoption, improved fuel efficiency, and behavior change are crucial for achieving long-term sustainability goals.
