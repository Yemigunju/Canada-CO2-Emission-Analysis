# Canada CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis

## üåç Project Overview

This project explores historical CO‚ÇÇ emission trends in Canada, analyzing the country's contribution to global emissions and examining the impact of population growth, energy use, and policy changes. Through data storytelling and visualization, the project aims to identify patterns and suggest actionable insights toward a more sustainable future.

## üéØ Project Objective

- Understand the historical trends of CO‚ÇÇ emissions in Canada.
- Identify major contributing sectors and years of significant emission shifts.
- Explore the relationship between population, GDP, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
- Suggest implications for climate policy and public awareness.

## üß† Methodology

The project was conducted using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and followed these steps:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Data sourced from publicly available repositories like *Our World in Data* or *World Bank*.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Managed missing values and formatted the dataset into a time series.
   - Filtered out Canadian data from the global dataset.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover trends.
   - Compared metrics like emissions per capita, per GDP unit, and by sector.
   - Explored correlations between population and emissions.

4. **Tools & Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` (if used).

## üìä Key Insights

- **Rising Emissions (1950s‚Äì2000s):** Emissions increased in line with population and industrial development.
- **Peak & Slight Decline Post-2008:** Likely due to a mix of economic slowdown and green policy impact.
- **Dominant Contributors:** Energy production and transportation sectors are the highest emitters.
- **High Per Capita Emissions:** Despite a small population, Canada's per capita CO‚ÇÇ output is significant.
- **Policy Influence:** Notable declines align with policy shifts or economic events.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Canada‚Äôs CO‚ÇÇ emissions show signs of decline, but high per capita figures and sector-specific emissions remain a concern. The data suggests ongoing investment in clean energy, transportation reform, and policy innovation is essential for long-term sustainability.
