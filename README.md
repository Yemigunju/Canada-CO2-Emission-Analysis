## 📊 Key Insights

- **Emissions Peak:** Emissions steadily increased until around 2008, followed by a gradual decline.
- **Sectoral Contributors:** The energy sector, particularly fossil fuels, is the dominant source of emissions.
- **Fuel Efficiency:** Different fuel types (e.g., diesel, gasoline) show varying emission efficiencies.
- **Population Link:** Emission trends closely mirror Canada's population and economic growth.
